# VideoSilenceCutter

## Overview
**VideoSilenceCutter** is a Python tool designed to automatically trim silent segments from video files, streamlining the video editing process. This project utilizes FFmpeg for audio processing, making it efficient and effective for content creators who spend excessive time manually editing videos.

## Features
- Detects silent parts of a video based on a configurable noise threshold and minimum silence duration.
- Trims the video automatically, outputting a new file without the silent segments.
- User-friendly, with clear instructions and customizable parameters.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg
- `moviepy` library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VideoSilenceCutter.git
   cd VideoSilenceCutter
Install the required dependencies:
Make sure FFmpeg is installed and its path is correctly set in the VideoSilenceCutter.py file.

2.Usage
Place your input video files in the Input folder.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized as follows:
 
 ```bash
VideoSilenceCutter/
│
├── Input/                        # Folder for input video files
│   └── TestVideo.mp4             # Example input video (placeholder)
│
├── Output/                       # Folder for output video files
│   └── Output.mp4                # Placeholder for trimmed output video
│
├── scripts/                      # Contains the main script
│   └── VideoSilenceCutter.py     # The main Python script for processing videos
│
├── requirements.txt              # List of dependencies (e.g., ffmpeg-python)
└── README.md                     # Project documentation


## Run the script:
python scripts/VideoSilenceCutter.py
The output video will be saved in the Output folder.

## Configuration
You can adjust the noise_threshold and min_silence_duration variables in the script to customize the silence detection criteria.
